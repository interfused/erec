	<p>No better time to get started with the process than right now!  Let’s take just a few seconds to upload what you have.  Even if you think it needs some updating or fine-tuning, having something is better than having nothing. </p>
	<p>This continues to be a very important step in the process.  Your resume is a traditional method for telling potential employers about you and your previous experience.  So to make sure when a Decision Maker is visiting your profile, they are able to find what they are looking for. Once we have them looking, you will have the opportunity to show them all the other reasons you will be a valuable asset to their organization! </p>
	<p>You have two options; you can choose to upload your current resume or if you do not have a resume or you would like us to assist you in updating you current resume, we have an option for that as well.</p>
	<p>What would you like to do now?</p>
