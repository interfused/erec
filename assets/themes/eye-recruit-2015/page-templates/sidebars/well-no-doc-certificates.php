	<p>Certifications show your continued interest in a profession or market.  A Decision Maker uses your documented accomplishments, not only to see where you have been, but also to evaluate where you might be going.  Help them make the best choice for the open position they are looking to fill, help them choose you.</p>
	<p>Providing a digital history of your accomplishments in this way show your on-going interest in the profession.  Let’s think logically on this. If the decision to hire someone comes down to two candidates; one candidate can show he or she has document accomplishments and obtained certifications of achievements since starting their career and the second candidate has never received any Certifications, ongoing training or has taken no steps showing initiative for advancement, who do you think will have the strategic advantage?</p>
	<p>Let’s take as much time as we need to collect all of our Certifications, no matter how minimal you consider them to be. If you need to come back to this step, that is not a problem.  We suggest getting the best-looking documents you can and sometimes that requires you to scan documents and then save later.  </p>
