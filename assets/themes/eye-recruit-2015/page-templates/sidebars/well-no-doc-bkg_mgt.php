		<p>A potential Employer may legally look into your background during the hiring process and require a background check to be conducted <strong>as a part of the hiring process.</strong> Over the course of a career you will have provided access to Local, State and Federal Criminal & civil histories, your credit report and a multitude of other background related inquiries to dozens, if not hunderds of times. Why not manage this process and give approval to people who should actually be seeing it? </p>
									<p class="indent"><strong>You don’t need to have a Background Search done by one of the potential vendors we suggest. Even though you can, you don’t even need to post the results of  a tihrd party Background Search that you conduct & requests yourself on the site.</strong></p>
									<p>In truth, you don't need to provide <em><u>anything</u></em> relating to your Background to a potential Employer to get the benefits of using the Eyerecruit.com services. Everything on Eyerecruit.com is self disclosed and designed to allow you to better manage your own carrier. But why not handle your Personal Background verifications like your Credit Report or FICO Score? </p>
									<p>Besides being able to provide permission on a case-by-case basis directly from the platfrom, you will be able to know immediately about potentially harmful errors contained within your background search that may have a negative impact on your ability to obtain gainful employment. With this knowledge you can get the issue addressed before it has a negative impact on your career and before a Decision Maker at an Employer you really would love to work for has less then the full story. </p>
									<p>Decide for yourself if you would like to order one of the Background Searches provided by the third parties we have provided for you or one you find yourself. Before you do, you can read here what the The United States Federal Trade Comission (FTC)  has posted on Employment Background Checks and thier suggestions on "fixing mistakes before an employer see it.</p>
